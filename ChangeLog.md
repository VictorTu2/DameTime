9/17: Started DameTime project. Found 3 and 2-point percentages for seasons 2015-2020 (6)

10/16: Expanded on the DameTime project. Cleaned up code using functions and expanded the analysis to comparing Dame with Curry and Booker

10/19: Implemented an if statement into the 3% and 2% calculations to account for 0 attempted shots.
       Removed team filtering becuase one player could have been on different teams in the past 6 seasons.
